          <ul>
            <li>
              Our facility offers an extensive place for your CrossFit and
              fitness practice. Across our 20,000 sq/ft gym space you’ll surely
              have more than enough room for maneuvering!
            </li>
            <li>
              Also, our downtown location is what makes us so appealing to so
              many people… Spacious area of that scale is more than enough both
              for group training as well as for the individual ones.
            </li>
            <li>
              Working on misc functional movements (like pushing, pulling,
              squatting, lifting, and running) has never been so easy and
              comfortable!
